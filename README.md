# WhatBytes FrontEnd Intern Assignment

WhatBytes is the frontend component of a dashboard that allows users to update their scores using a modal interface and showcases the results through responsive graphs and charts. The project emphasizes responsive and adaptive design principles, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.

## Features

- **Score Update Modal**: Users can update their scores through a user-friendly modal interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, with the "Skill-wise" and "Question Analysis" sections dynamically repositioning to ensure optimal visibility.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays updated scores and performance metrics using interactive graphs and pie charts.
- **Next.js & Tailwind CSS**: Built with Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and responsive design.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
- **Chart.js or Recharts**: Libraries for rendering responsive graphs and charts (you can choose either based on your preference).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mridulti/whatbytes-submission.git
   cd whatbytes-submission
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Your application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- Navigate to the dashboard, where you can update scores using the modal.
- View the updated scores visualized through graphs and charts.
- Resize your browser window to see how the layout adjusts responsively.

## Responsive Design

The layout of the application is designed to adapt based on the screen size. On smaller screens, the "Skill-wise" and "Question Analysis" sections will move to the bottom of the page for improved readability and user experience.

## Demo

A video demonstration of the project will be attached as part of the internship assignment.
